# toki Ramble
in which i ramble in toki pona to feed a possible future neural network

**<!--sizestart-->7.4<!--sizeend-->k** characters across **<!--countstart-->3<!--countend-->** files

i tend to generate 3 random non-gender content words as inspiration, which i then make a proper grammatical topic out of because i wanna be able to prompt the future nn with just a topic

maybe sentence-pair translations too eventually idk

all this is [cc0](LICENSE) i don't care

## table that i'm probably gonna remove eventually

| topic | prompt | description |
|-:|:-:|:-|
| [mi lon kulupu kule mute, taso mi kule mute ala](toki/mi%20lon%20kulupu%20kule%20mute,%20taso%20mi%20kule%20mute%20ala.txt) | mute kulupu kule | "i'm not that queer but i'm mostly in queer groups" turned into general mildly-sad-bean hours (various thoughts that i've had for weeks waiting to be written somewhere) this project is off to a great start and it doesn't even follow the topic all the way how can i expect an nn to keep it if i can't |
| [olin li seme?](toki/olin%20li%20seme.txt) | sona olin lon | supposedly talking about what love is, veering off to aro folk and [polycul.es](https://polycul.es/) and brain chemicals and religion |
| [nena sinpin](toki/nena%20sinpin.txt) | nena ken ni | just some nose factoids |
