# toki Ramble
in which i ramble in toki pona to feed a possible future neural network

i tend to generate 3 random non-gender content words as inspiration, which i then make a proper grammatical topic out of because i wanna be able to prompt the future nn with just a topic

maybe sentence-pair translations too eventually idk

all this is [cc0](./LICENSE) i don't care

## table that i'm probably gonna remove eventually

| topic | prompt | description |
|-:|:-:|:-|
| [mi lon kulupu kule mute](mi%20lon%20kulupu%20kule%20mute.txt) | mute kulupu kule | "i'm not that queer but i'm mostly in queer groups" turned into general mildly-sad-bean hours this project is off to a great start (and it doesn't even follow the topic all the way how can i expect an nn to keep it if i can't) |
