# toki Ramble
in which i ramble in toki pona to feed a possible future neural network

**<!--sizestart-->10.9<!--sizeend-->k** characters across **<!--countstart-->5<!--countend-->** files

i tend to generate 3 random non-gender content words as inspiration, which i then make a proper grammatical topic out of because i wanna be able to prompt the future nn with just a topic

maybe sentence-pair translations too eventually idk

all this is [cc0](LICENSE) i don't care

## table that i'm probably gonna remove eventually

| topic | prompt | description |
|-:|:-:|:-|
| [toki nasa pi ike mi](toki/toki%20nasa%20pi%20ike%20mi.txt) | mute kulupu kule | "i'm not that queer but i'm mostly in queer groups" turned into general mildly-sad-bean hours (various thoughts that i've had for weeks waiting to be written somewhere) this project is off to a great start and it doesn't even follow the topic all the way how can i expect an nn to keep it if i can't |
| [olin li seme?](toki/olin%20li%20seme.txt) | sona olin lon | supposedly talking about what love is, veering off to aro folk and [polycul.es](https://polycul.es/) and brain chemicals and religion |
| [nena sinpin](toki/nena%20sinpin.txt) | nena ken ni | just some nose factoids |
| [esun pu](toki/esun%20pu.txt) | pu ma mani | completely ignored `ma` oops |
| [nena mama](toki/nena%20mama.txt) | tawa soweli nena | i'm a bit excited, because this ramble is a first in a few ways: it has the first prompt generated by a dedicated bot (thank you ijo Sasi), it's the first time i've skipped a topic (`pali nasa kepeken`, was gonna write about `pali nasa li wile e ilo nasa`), and it's the first ramble that broke the daily streak |
